Ans1:	The user can select from the options available and can enter its own data as well
	The list attribute refers to a <datalist> element that contains pre-defined options for an <input> element.
	The <datalist> tag specifies a list of pre-defined options for an <input> element.
	The <datalist> tag is used to provide an "autocomplete" feature for <input> elements. Users will see a drop-down list of pre-defined options as they 	input data.
The <datalist> element's id attribute must be equal to the <input> element's list attribute (this binds them together).
<form action="/action_page.php" method="get">

  <label for="browser">Choose your browser from the list:</label>
  <input list="browsers" name="browser" id="browser">
  <datalist id="browsers">
    <option value="Edge">
    <option value="Firefox">
    <option value="Chrome">
    <option value="Opera">
    <option value="Safari">
  </datalist>
  <input type="submit">
</form>
