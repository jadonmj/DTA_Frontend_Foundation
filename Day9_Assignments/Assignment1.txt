3. What is an Object? What is an Array in Javascript?

Ans1.	JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
	JSON data is written as name/value pairs, just like JavaScript object properties.
	A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value:
	JSON names require double quotes. JavaScript names do not.

Ans2.	JSON Objects
JSON objects are written inside curly braces.
Just like in JavaScript, objects can contain multiple name/value pairs:
{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}

JSON arrays are written inside square brackets.
Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain objects:
"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}]
In the example above, the object "employees" is an array. It contains three objects.
Each object is a record of a person (with a first name and a last name).



The JSON.stringify() method converts a JavaScript value to a JSON string, optionally replacing values if a replacer function is specified or optionally including only the specified properties if a replacer array is specified.

JSON.parse() parses a string, written in JSON format, and returns a JavaScript object.
