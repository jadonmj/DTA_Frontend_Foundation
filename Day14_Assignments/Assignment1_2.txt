Ans1: Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap. They are used to contain, pad, and center the content within them. The container-fluid class is used for a full-width container and spans the entire width of the viewport.

Ans2: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a collection of computers that keep data copies at several network nodes. A well-designed and adequately executed CDN increases data access by increasing bandwidth and reducing access latency. Web objects, apps, database queries, downloadable data objects, and video streams are all examples of CDN content.
Advantages:
1-Increasing the speed with which a website's pages load
2-Lowering the cost of bandwidth
3-Increasing the availability and redundancy of content
4-Increasing the safety of your website.
