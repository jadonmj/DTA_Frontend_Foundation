Ans 1: Quickly and easily clear floated content within a container by adding a clearfix utility.
Easily clear floats by adding .clearfix to the parent element. Can also be used as a mixin.

<div class="bg-info clearfix">
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary float-start">Example Button floated left</button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary float-end">Example Button floated right</button>
</div>

Ans 2 : the .d-none class hides the HTML element on all devices, and the .d-sm-block class shows the element on small devices and beyond.
ex- <div class="d-none">hide screen example</div>

Ans 3 : Bootstrap “spinners” can be used to show the loading state in your projects. They’re built only with HTML and CSS, meaning you don’t need any JavaScript to create them. You will, however, need some custom JavaScript to toggle their visibility.
